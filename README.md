This is the fourth project in the Odin Project fullstack JavaScript course.

The task is to build a small app that resembles a library. Users should be able to add a book to the library, remove a book from the library and update whether they have read each book yet. There is also the option of adding data storage, whether via Web Storage API or local storage.

Ramblings as I work on the project:

1. I'd like to try building this project with more structure than the past projects. I'll do this by extracting an initial set of requirements and adding more complexity as I progress. I would like to do this because although I was able to complete the previous projects, I feel like they took more time than necessary because my focus kept shifting as a result of a lack of direction. I think creating and following a requirements doc will also allow me to practice scoping and chunking work in a more manageable way.
